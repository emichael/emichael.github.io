  <h1>Deadlock Freedom: Beyond Liveness Properties</h1>
  
  <p class="date">19 Jan 2023</p>

  <h3>Properties</h3>

<p>In their classic paper, &ldquo;Defining Liveness&rdquo;
<a class="citation" href="#alpern87:defining-liveness">[1]</a>, Alpern and Schneider show that all
properties of distributed systems are the conjunction of a safety property and a
liveness property. Informally, safety properties specify the &ldquo;bad things&rdquo; that
should not happen while liveness properties specify the &ldquo;good things&rdquo; that must
happen. More formally, safety properties are the properties which can always be
falsified by <em>finite traces</em> and liveness properties are the properties which
can only be falsified by <em>infinite traces</em>. If \(S\) is the set of program
states, \(S^\omega\) is the set of infinite sequences of program states, and
\(S^*\) is the set of finite sequences of program states then \(P\) is a
safety property if</p>

\[\forall \sigma \in S^\omega : \exists i \ge 0 : \forall \beta \in S^\omega :
\sigma \not \in P \implies \sigma[..i]\beta \not \in P\]

<p>and \(P\) is a liveness property if</p>

\[\forall \alpha \in S^* : \exists \beta \in S^\omega : \alpha \beta \in P \ .\]

<p>Here, \(\sigma[..i]\) is just the finite sequence with the first \(i\)
elements of \(\sigma\) and \(\sigma[..i] \beta\) and \(\alpha \beta\) are
concatenations of sequences.</p>

<p>Alpern and Schneider also give two different proofs that <em>any property</em> can be
decomposed into a safety property and a liveness property, one based on topology
and one based on automata theory
<a class="citation" href="#alpern87:defining-liveness">[1, 2]</a>.
I haven&rsquo;t yet defined what a &ldquo;property&rdquo; is, though. It&rsquo;s implicit in the above
definitions, but in this characterization, <strong>a property is just a set of
(infinite) traces</strong>!</p>

<h3>The Properties of Consensus</h3>

<p>Properties are powerful and can be used to specify important things we want from
our distributed systems. For example, the specification of the consensus problem
can be expressed as the intersection of a safety property &ndash; all correct
processes that decide a value decide the same value, and that value must have
been some input value &ndash; and a liveness property &ndash; all correct (non-failing)
processes eventually decide a value.</p>

<p>Sometimes, proving properties (especially liveness properties) of systems
requires making additional assumptions. Consider the termination guarantees of a
system like Paxos. We know that consensus in an asynchronous environment with
the possibility of a single process failure cannot be solved (without
randomization) <a class="citation" href="#flp">[3]</a>. In particular, protocols which guarantee safety
cannot guarantee termination. However, people use protocols such as Paxos in
practice. Are these practitioners just religious zealots in the Paxos cult,
believing without any basis that Paxos will save them from the evils of
impossibility results? Of course not! We <em>can</em> prove things about the liveness
of Paxos; in particular, a Paxos implementation with a well-designed leader
election mechanism can guarantee liveness during periods of sufficient
synchrony.</p>

<p>How do we formalize what &ldquo;periods of sufficient synchrony&rdquo; are? One way people
do this is through the use of failure detectors. If you equip each replica with
a failure detector which is responsible for informing the replica when the
current leader has failed, then we know that as long as the failure detectors
behave at least as well as \(\diamond W\), the weakest failure detector that
can solve consensus <a class="citation" href="#chandra96:weak-fail">[4]</a>, (and as long as the network
itself satisfies basic fairness criteria<sup id="fnref:fairness" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fairness" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>) then the system is
guaranteed to eventually make progress. The way that you could disprove that
Paxos (or an implementation of Paxos) satisfies this &ldquo;\(\diamond W\)-termination&rdquo; liveness property is by describing an infinite (fair) execution
of Paxos in which the failure detectors satisfy the \(\diamond W\) guarantees,
no more than \(f\) processes fail, and some correct process never decides a
value.</p>

<h3>Deadlock Freedom</h3>

<p>While proving liveness properties of consensus protocols like Paxos is useful,
it will always involve making additional assumptions about the well-behavedness
of the environment. I claim, however, that there is something much more basic
that we would like to say about Paxos and many other distributed protocols and
implementations of those protocols that <em>does not</em> rely on any additional
assumptions. I&rsquo;ve been calling this property deadlock freedom.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
  <b>Deadlock Freedom:</b>
  The system cannot reach a state from which no terminating state is reachable.
</p>

<p>Notice that deadlock freedom is neither a safety nor liveness property &ndash; it&rsquo;s
not a property at all! We can easily express it in a branching temporal logic
such as CTL (e.g., \(\mathbf{AG}. \mathbf{EF}. termination\)), but deadlock
freedom cannot be falsified with a single trace. Just because a system <em>can</em>
fail to make progress forever doesn&rsquo;t mean that it ever reaches a state from
which progress is impossible. However, <strong>any liveness properties that you wish
to prove about a system will imply deadlock freedom</strong>, unless additional
assumptions you employ to prove liveness make the dead states unreachable.</p>

<p>You might think that deadlock freedom is actually a safety property. After all,
deadlocks in a multi-threaded locking scheme can be detected by looking for
cycles in the wait-for graph. If a locking system cannot reach a cyclically
waiting state, then it is free of deadlocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deadlocks&rdquo; in distributed systems, however, can be much more subtle. Imagine
implementing a 500,000 line system that contains a dozen different roles that
nodes can play. Proving (or even knowing) all of the ways in which such a system
could get permanently stuck, were they to occur, might be extremely difficult.
But expressing the ways in which the system can make progress might be
comparatively easy. We would like to be able to express useful attributes of our
systems (such as deadlock freedom) without needing to prove complicated
theorems.</p>

<p>Deadlock freedom is also a useful attribute of systems to look for in model
checkers. In <a href="/dslabs/">DSLabs</a>, while we do not check for deadlock freedom in
general, we do check that student implementations can make progress <em>from
specific intermediate states</em>.</p>

<h3>Hyperproperties</h3>

<p>While deadlock freedom is not a property, it <em>is</em> a hyperproperty.
Hyperproperties, as defined by Clarkson and Schneider, are <strong>sets of sets of
(infinite) traces</strong> <a class="citation" href="#clarkson_hyperproperties_2010">[5]</a>. A distributed
system satisfies a hyperproperty if the complete set of possible executions it
can produce is in the hyperproperty. In light of hyperproperties, what we have
been just calling &ldquo;properties&rdquo; up until now are referred to as <strong>trace
properties</strong> for clarity.</p>

<p>It turns out that there is an analogous safety and liveness decomposition for
hyperproperties! Safety hyperproperties are the hyperproperties which can always
be falsified by <em>finite sets of finite traces</em>,<sup id="fnref:hypersafety" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hypersafety" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and liveness
hyperproperties are hyperproperties which cannot be falsified by finite sets of
finite traces.<sup id="fnref:hyperliveness" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hyperliveness" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> (See the hyperproperties paper for a more full
discussion of the definitions of hyperproperties <a class="citation" href="#clarkson_hyperproperties_2010">[5]</a>.) Furthermore, every hyperproperty is the
conjunction of a safety hyperproperty and a liveness hyperproperty.</p>

<p>Deadlock freedom is a liveness hyperproperty. It cannot be falsified with finite
traces at all. A counter-example to deadlock freedom would have to show that
there is some state that is reachable, and in all possible executions which
reach that state, termination/progress is never achieved.</p>

<p>Hyperproperties were introduced to specify important security policies (such as
secure information flow) and complex liveness requirements (e.g., SLAs such as
mean response time). However, as we have seen, they can be much more basic.
Deadlock freedom is a liveness hyperproperty which is broadly applicable and
extremely desirable. While trace properties are a useful narrowing of
hyperproperties because they can be more amenable to certain formal methods
techniques such as verification and model checking, a broader understanding of
the specification of distributed systems <em>must</em> include hyperproperties, which I
do not think are as widely understood, hence the reason for this blog post.</p>

      <p>The fairness criteria that are assumed vary, but one basic
         assumption that is usually necessary is that all processes either
         fail or take infinitely many steps. The FLP impossibility result
         assumes that all messages are eventually delivered (as long as the
         receiver has not failed), which is a particularly strong assumption
         but only broadens the applicability of the impossibility
         result. When proving the liveness of protocols, weaker
         assumptions about message delivery are often assumed. For example,
         a fair-lossy network only guarantees that if a message is sent
         infinitely many times (from the same sender to the same receiver),
         then it is delivered infinitely many times.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:fairness" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>That is, no complete set of executions which extends a
            counter-example set of finite traces will satisfy a safety
            hyperproperty. If we have two sets of (possibly infinite) traces
            \(A\) and \(B\), then \(A \le B\) if \(\forall a \in A :
            \exists b \in B : a \le b\) where \(a \le b\) means that \(a\) is a prefix of \(b\). A hyperproperty is a safety
            hyperproperty if, for every set of executions, \(T\) which
            does not satisfy the safety hyperproperty, there exists a finite
            set of finite traces \(C \le T\) such that for all \(T' \ge C\), \(T'\) also does not satisfy the hyperproperty.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:hypersafety" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
