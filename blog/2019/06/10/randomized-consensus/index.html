  <h1>Randomized Consensus on Unknown Domains in Finite Rounds</h1>
  
  <p class="date">10 Jun 2019</p>

  <p>The most widely known result in distributed computing is the FLP result that
proves the impossibility of consensus <a class="citation" href="#flp">[1]</a>. One of the assumptions of
this theorem is that processes are <em>deterministic</em>. When randomness is allowed,
the Ben-Or algorithm gives simple, elegant way to solve binary consensus <a class="citation" href="#ben-or83:anot-adva">[2]</a>. Or rather, \(\text{lim}_{t \to \infty} P(\text{consensus
has been reached}) = 1\). The algorithm goes something like this.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a = input({0, 1})

loop:
  send_phase1(a)
  A = receive_phase1()
  if ∃aʹ∈ A : |{a''∈ A : a'' = a'}| &gt; n/2:
    b = a'
  else:
    b = ⊥

  send_phase2(b)
  B = receive_phase2()
  if ∃bʹ∈ B : b' != ⊥ &amp;&amp; |{b'' ∈ B : b'' = b'}| &gt; f:
    decide(bʹ)
  if ∃bʹ∈ B : b' != ⊥:
    a = b'
  else:
    a = choose_random({0, 1})
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The algorithm proceeds in asynchronous rounds, each with two phases. In each
phase, each process broadcasts its value for the phase and then waits for the
values of \(n - f\) other processes. The safety argument is not complicated,
and the termination argument is even more straightforward. Eventually the random
choices made by processes in some round will be overwhelmingly in favor of
either 0 or 1, and that value will decided by every process in the next round.</p>

<p>This blog post is a record of a couple simple observations I made when
re-reading the paper recently (in preparation for teaching it in 
<a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse452/19sp/">UW&rsquo;s distributed systems course</a>
this past quarter) that I couldn&rsquo;t find written up anywhere else.</p>

<h2>Unknown Domains</h2>

<p>The first observation is that this algorithm can be modified to allow processes
to have inputs values from larger domains than \(\{0, 1\}\). In fact, the input
domain can be infinite. Furthermore, we don&rsquo;t even need the processes to know
the input domain <em>a priori</em>. On the very last line of the protocol, when
processes make a random choice, they simply choose from <em>all values seen so
far</em> in any message.</p>

<p>Since there are at most <em>n</em> possible input values (because there are at most <em>n</em>
processes), the termination argument still applies. The only real difference is
that termination could take longer. The original paper contained a theorem that
when \(f\) is \(O(\sqrt{n})\), the expected number of rounds is constant. That
theorem no longer applies when the set of possible decision values grows with \(n\).</p>

<p>The other interesting fact is that this protocol can be further modified to
support a model where not all processes get input values. Processes without
input values initialize \(a = \bot\) on the first line. And on the last line
when random choices are made, processes choose from all non-\(\bot\) values
seen. As long as at least \(f + 1\) processes get input values, termination is
still guaranteed. Even more interestingly, the check on first-phase messages can
be refined somewhat in this case. The property that must be maintained is that
no second-phase messages with different non-\(\bot\) values should exist for the
same round. So, assuming we get \(n - f\) messages in the second round, if the
number of messages for one non-\(\bot\) value is more than \(f\) greater
than for every other non-\(\bot\) value, then we can safely choose that for the
second phase.</p>

<p>Both of these modifications are important for the way people use consensus in
the real world — namely to implement state machine replication. The commands
proposed to the state machine log often come from an infinite domain and are
chosen by clients at runtime. The servers implementing the state machine do not
know which commands will be proposed <em>a priori</em>. Furthermore, we would like the
system to make progress even when clients don&rsquo;t send their commands to all
servers.</p>

<h2>Finite Rounds</h2>

<p>The other observation is that the original protocol had all processes taking
protocol steps and sending messages forever, even after they had decided values.
This is not necessary. Instead, we can have processes send messages for each
phase <em>proactively</em> up until they&rsquo;ve decided a value and the <em>reactively</em>
thereafter. That is, once a process has reached a decision, it only sends a
message for a phase after it has received at least one message for that phase
(or a later phase).</p>

<p>Because all non-faulty processes eventually decide a value, eventually all
processes stop sending messages. Note, however, that this does not mean
processes can halt. They must continue listening for messages forever (or at
least \(f+1\) processes must). Eventually, however, they will no longer send any
new messages.</p>

<p>When combined the model above where not all processes get input values, we could
also specify that processes which have not seen any non-\(\bot\) values remain
in a reactive mode until they receive a non-\(\bot\) value.</p>
