  <h1>Understanding Traces</h1>
  
  <p class="date">18 Feb 2019</p>

  <p>For <a href="https://github.com/emichael/dslabs">DSLabs</a>, one of the pieces I built was a 
<a href="https://github.com/emichael/dslabs/blob/409be9bb71dc0844f24f502d658a47bf1bd9715b/framework/tst/dslabs/framework/testing/search/SearchState.java#L329">post-processing phase</a> that runs on traces generated by the
model checker. It takes a trace (i.e., a list of events) and produces a
semantically equivalent trace which is, hopefully, more understandable to
humans.</p>

<p>To motivate the problem, lets look at an example. Suppose we have a distributed
system with four processes &mdash; \(p_1\), \(p_2\), \(p_3\), and \(p_4\),
and consider the events represented by the following space-time diagram:</p>

<p><img src="/img/tikz/d4df8b5866db57366e979b530d98ea40.svg" class="tikz" style="width: 300px;" /></p>

<p>Because there are <em>concurrent</em> events (i.e., events not ordered by the
happens-before relation) in the above execution, there is more than one way to
represent these events as a well-formed trace.<sup id="fnref:num-traces" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:num-traces" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Here, a well-formed
trace is one in which the happens-before relation is respected by the ordering
of events. However, not all traces are created equal. Without knowing the
specifics of the protocol being run in this execution, I think most people, if
asked to produce a trace, would write something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>\(p_1\) sends \(m_1\) to \(p_2\)</li>
  <li>\(p_2\) receives \(m_1\), sends \(m_2\) to \(p_1\)</li>
  <li>\(p_1\) receives \(m_2\), sends \(m_3\) to \(p_2\)</li>
  <li>\(p_2\) receives \(m_3\)</li>
  <li>\(p_3\) sends \(m_4\) to \(p_4\)</li>
  <li>\(p_4\) receives \(m_4\), sends \(m_5\) to \(p_3\)</li>
  <li>\(p_3\) receives \(m_5\), sends \(m_6\) to \(p_4\)</li>
  <li>\(p_4\) receives \(m_6\)</li>
</ul>

<p>They might, instead, pair up \(m_1\) and \(m_4\), \(m_2\) and \(m_5\),
and \(m_3\) and \(m_6\). But they certainly wouldn&rsquo;t write down the
following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>\(p_1\) sends \(m_1\) to \(p_2\)</li>
  <li>\(p_3\) sends \(m_4\) to \(p_4\)</li>
  <li>\(p_2\) receives \(m_1\), sends \(m_2\) to \(p_1\)</li>
  <li>\(p_1\) receives \(m_2\), sends \(m_3\) to \(p_2\)</li>
  <li>\(p_4\) receives \(m_4\), sends \(m_5\) to \(p_3\)</li>
  <li>\(p_2\) receives \(m_3\)</li>
  <li>\(p_3\) receives \(m_5\), sends \(m_6\) to \(p_4\)</li>
  <li>\(p_4\) receives \(m_6\)</li>
</ul>

<p>Not just that, but the latter trace is also harder to follow as a reader. It has
several unnecessary &ldquo;context switches.&rdquo; The DSLabs model checker, however, does
not distinguish between these two traces; they both have the same length. If an
invariant was violated upon completion of the execution in question, the
concurrent events in the trace produced by the model checker would be randomly
ordered.</p>

<p>The post-processing phase I implemented is based on a simple idea, that events
in traces should be followed by their immediate consequences. First, I took the
trace produced by the model checker and built up the associated event graph. The
event graph looks just like the space-time diagram above. Vertices are events;
edges go between corresponding <em>send</em> and <em>receive</em> events and between
subsequent events at the same process.</p>

<p>Then, I ran a depth-first topological sort of the event graph. By topologically
sorting the graph, we get a well-formed trace. By doing it in a depth-first
manner, we list events and their immediate consequences whenever possible.</p>

<p>To see what this looks like in practice, let&rsquo;s look at an example from the
primary-backup lab. First, we show an animated trace demonstrating an
invariant-violation in a buggy solution.</p>

<video controls="" loop="loop" preload="metadata">
  <source src="/img/posts/understanding-traces/ugly-trace.webm#t=0.1" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/img/posts/understanding-traces/ugly-trace.mp4#t=0.1" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>Next, let&rsquo;s see what the same invariant-violation looks with the post-processing
phase for understandability.</p>

<video controls="" loop="loop" preload="metadata">
  <source src="/img/posts/understanding-traces/good-trace.webm#t=0.1" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/img/posts/understanding-traces/good-trace.mp4#t=0.1" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>Of course, you can&rsquo;t necessarily follow what&rsquo;s going on without knowing the
details of the protocol. But, it should be much easier to follow the &ldquo;flow&rdquo; of
the second video.</p>

<p>There are many possibilities for further improvement. You could bias the sorting
of events towards message delivery or towards staying with the same process. You
could even try to recognize group communication patterns (e.g., the
&ldquo;one→all→one&rdquo; pattern) and order them in particular ways. For now, though, I think this solution works quite well.</p>
