  <h1>Search For Course Builder</h1>
  
    <p class="subtitle">A Google Intern's Tale</p>
  
  <p class="date">14 Aug 2013</p>

  <h2>Who I Am</h2>
<p>I am a software engineering intern at Google on the
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/">Course Builder</a> team. I attend the <a href="http://utexas.edu/">University of Texas at
Austin</a>, pursuing degrees in computer science and the
<a href="http://www.utexas.edu/cola/progs/plan2/">liberal arts</a>. As a high school student, I made use of free,
online materials, often in the form of college lectures when I was not being
challenged in the classroom. Technology cannot solve all the problems in
education but, I know firsthand that it can help. My decision to work on Course
Builder did not begin with a desire to work in online education, however, but
from my (almost) lifelong love affair with Google, its products, and its mission
to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and
useful. When I got a call from my future intern host on the Course Builder team
offering me a summer job at my first-choice company working on a problem I am
passionate about, I accepted the offer rather quickly.</p>

<h2>What Course Builder Is</h2>
<p>Course Builder is an open source project started by Google in 2012 that provides
all of the tools for someone to create an interactive online course. It is
Google&rsquo;s first foray into a tool of this kind and is already being used by
educators throughout the world. Course Builder is built on
<a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> in Python.</p>

<h2>My Project</h2>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>When I was thinking about how I might use my summer, I wanted to build out a
feature that would be immediately useful for students. I thought about various
integrations with other Google products that could facilitate collaboration or
help organize course materials for students, but I kept coming back to one
feature I thought was obviously missing: search! Imagine a student working on a
Latin assignment and struggling to remember how the gerundive is used. In a
traditional course, that student might use the textbook’s index to find the
relative page. In an online course, a student would need to find the relevant
page by searching through the course’s structure manually. If the gerundive was
explained in a video, as content in online courses often is, she would need to
tediously skip through the video a minute at a time hoping to hear something
familiar. It would be much better if the student could simply search for
&ldquo;gerundive&rdquo; and be presented with the relevant information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;Google already does search! Why reinvent the wheel?&rdquo; To that I
respond: I’m not trying to reinvent the wheel, but I do not think that a full
internet search is appropriate here. Our Latin student could have searched the
web for information about the gerundive, but she would have been inundated with
complicated and unfamiliar definitions. Moreover, if she were studying a more
arcane subject, she might not find any information at all.</p>

<p>So, I decided to implement search so that any student taking a Course Builder
course could navigate courses quickly.</p>

<h3>Research Phase</h3>
<p>When I stated that I didn’t want to reinvent the wheel, what I meant was that I
never planned on creating a search platform from scratch, or at the very least,
this was a last resort as it would mean that I would have far less time
developing user-facing features. Before I began searching for possible search
platforms, however, I needed a list of key features that I wanted to implement
so that I could assess the relative goodness of each possible solution. I came
up with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The platform needed to be fast and support thousands of concurrent queries per
second.</li>
  <li>I wanted to be able to search through transcripts of YouTube videos and return
a video fast-forwarded to the relevant spot.</li>
  <li>The delay between a change in the course’s content and the corresponding
update of the search index needed to be small.</li>
</ul>

<p>After some searching, I came up with a few options: the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Whoosh/">Whoosh package</a>
for Python, <a href="https://www.google.com/cse/">Google&rsquo;s Custom Search Engine</a>, and the new <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/search/">Full-Text Search
API</a> for Google App Engine (GAE). Though Custom Search Engine
was initially attractive because it would require a minimal implementation on
the Course Builder side, and the search results would benefit from Google&rsquo;s
ranking algorithms, I had to rule it out because it would not allow me the
flexibility to search YouTube transcripts. The GAE API was quite new, and I was
wary of it. Whoosh seemed like the most full-featured and stable option, so I
created two quick prototypes, one outside of GAE and one inside it. I subjected
the sans-GAE one to several load tests, and it performed admirably, but when I
tried running Whoosh inside GAE, I ran into problems. Whoosh uses the pickle
module to serialize its search index, and because of differences in the standard
Python environment and GAE, this problem turned into a nonstarter. It may not
sound like a huge issue, but after burning a couple days trying to resolve it, I
found out just how large a problem serialization can be and abandoned Whoosh.
After cobbling together a quick prototype using GAE&rsquo;s Full-Text Search API
inside Course Builder and subjecting it to a load test, I decided that even
though it was still in the preview stage, it would work and was my best option.</p>

<h3>Design Overview</h3>
<p>If you want to know more about how search engines work in general, you can find
plenty of information via your favorite search engine. If you need help using
your favorite search engine, there&rsquo;s a great course to help you
<a href="http://www.powersearchingwithgoogle.com/course/ps/course.html">here</a>!</p>

<p>When I decided to take on search, it was immediately obvious that it would fit
in quite well with Course Builder&rsquo;s existing modular structure. In designing any
peripheral feature for a product, the key is defining and limiting the interface
with the rest of the product and with the feature&rsquo;s dependencies. In the most
general terms, I decided to separate the search module into two files,
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/source/browse/coursebuilder/modules/search/search.py"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">search.py</code></a> which depends on App Engine&rsquo;s search API and contains
all of the module&rsquo;s interface methods, and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/source/browse/coursebuilder/modules/search/resources.py"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">resources.py</code></a> which
depends on Course Builder and manages the discovery of course resources. Here,
resource refers to lessons, announcements, external links, YouTube videos linked
to in the course, and others.</p>

<p>I wanted to keep the search interface as small as possible, and I ended up with
three methods: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index_all_docs</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clear_index</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code>. These three methods
were sufficient to cover all of the functionality I needed, and limiting myself
to these three helped control the complexity and made the interface easy to
test.</p>

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">resources.py</code>, I needed to handle both resource discovery and differential
presentation in search results (i.e. displaying YouTube videos as videos). In
the interest of clearly separating two concerns, I implemented two classes,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Resource</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Result</code>, and for each resource in the course that I wanted to
index and search over, I created a subclass of each of these. The subclass of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Resource</code> is responsible for finding all of the relevant resources in the
course and creating an index document, which is then put into the App Engine
search index. The subclass of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Result</code> is responsible for taking a result
returned by the App Engine search index and formatting it based on the type of
the original document.</p>

<h3>Future Work</h3>
<p>While Course Builder&rsquo;s search module is a robust, end-to-end feature, there is
still plenty of room for improvement. One thing I would like to see is analytics
for the search history of a course. This would allow course authors to see what
students are searching for most frequently and potentially give them insights
into what students are struggling to comprehend or retain. More resources from a
course, such as questions or PDF files, could be indexed. Also, I think making
the search algorithm context-aware would have great value (e.g. videos and pages
a student has recently viewed are given higher priority in the search results).</p>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>I do not have the time nor the energy to enumerate all of the things I learned
this summer; I would be writing for days. Instead, I will attempt to restrict
myself to the highlights. Firstly, I learned a great deal about software
engineering and working on a team. For the first time this summer, I went
through a real code review process, and I cannot overstate how valuable it was
to receive almost immediate feedback on every line of code I wrote. My coding
abilities improved, and I began to internalize the reviewer&rsquo;s voice so that
while I was programming, I was always thinking of what my reviewer might say. I
also learned a great deal about minimizing dependencies and isolating features
so that processes like the indexing pipeline are fault-tolerant and independent
from the rest of the code base.</p>

<p>More importantly, though, I learned a great deal about myself. In a very short
amount of time, having never written production Python code and having never
used Google&rsquo;s internal tools or infrastructure, I was able to become a
productive member of my team at one of the most technically-proficient companies
in the world. That felt good, and it taught me that I have what it takes to be
able to create good software. I contributed a feature to a product that will
help improve education for thousands of students, and doing that showed me that
I really can affect change in the world. I like that feeling, too, and I think
that for me, this is just the beginning.</p>

<p>So, thank you to Google and the Course Builder team for the opportunity to work
on such a great project and your excellent guidance. It has been a wonderful
summer, and I could not have done it without you.</p>
